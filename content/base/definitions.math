  Metadata: 
  . overview: "Everything item in this collection
               has an associated type.  For example,
               the type of an item could be an
               integer or a real number.  These
               types can be related.

               For example, it is possible to view
               an integer as a real number.  Moreover,
               when talking about sets, the elements
               of the set are always of the same type.

               This makes it easier to avoid pathologies
               when discussing sets."
