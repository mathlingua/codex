# Field Theory

Now we can define what a *field* is.  Essentially, a field
is a set of elements with the operations of addition and
multiplication that is an Abelian group under addition and
an Abelian group (excluding $0$) under multplication.

Thus a field abstracts the familiar algebraic details of the
real numbers.  That is, the order of addition and multplication
doesn`\'`t matter and any non-zero real number $x$ has a
multiplicative inverse, namely $1/x$.
::


[\field]
Defines: F := (X, +, *, 0, 1)
means:
. '(X, +, 0) is \abelian.group'
. '(X \set.minus/ 0, *, 1) is \abelian.group'
. forAll: x, y, z
  suchThat: 'x, y, z in X'
  then:
  . 'x*(y + z) = x*y + x*z'
viewing:
. as: '\set'
  via: 'X'
written: "\textrm{field}"


::
A field has operations of addition and multiplication.
However, subtraction is just defined as the inverse
operation of addition, defined below.
::


[\additive.inverse:of{x}:inField{F}]
Defines: y
given: (X, +, *, 0, 1)
when:
. 'F := (X, +, *, 0, 1) is \field'
. 'x in X'
means:
. 'x + y = 0'
written: "-x?"
called: "additive inverse of $x?$"


[x \field{F}.-/ y]
States:
given: (X, +, *, 0, 1)
when:
. 'F := (X, +, *, 0, 1) is \field'
. 'x, y in X'
that:
. 'x + \additive.inverse:of{y}:inField{F}'
written: "x?? - y??"
called: "$x??$ minus $y??$"


::
Similarly, for non-zero elements of a field, division of
two elements is defined as the inverse operation of
multiplication in the field.
::


[\multiplicative.inverse:of{x}:inField{F}]
Defines: y
given: (X, +, *, 0, 1)
when:
. 'F := (X, +, *, 0, 1) is \field'
. 'x in X'
. 'x \neq/ 0'
means:
. 'x * y = 1'
written: "x??^{-1}"
called: "multiplicative inverse of $x?$"


[x \field{F}.div/ y]
States:
given: (X, +, *, 0, 1)
when:
. 'F := (X, +, *, 0, 1) is \field'
. 'x, y in X'
that:
. 'x * \multiplicative.inverse:of{y}:inField{F}'
written: "x? y??^{-1}"
called: "$x?$ times the inverse of $y?$"



::
Now, to incorporate the details of the previous section,
a field that has an order is called an *ordered field*.

The real numbers will turn out to be an ordered field
with the ordering given by the familiar notion of
$x < y$ for two real numbers $x$ and $y$.
::


[\ordered.field]
Defines: F := (X, +, *, 0, 1, <)
means:
. '(X, +, *, 0, 1) is \field'
. forAll: x, y, z
  suchThat: 'x, y, z in X'
  then:
  . if: 'x < y'
    then: 'x + z < y + z'
. forAll: x, y, z
  suchThat: 'x, y, z in X'
  then:
  . if:
    . '0 < x'
    . '0 < y'
    then:
    . '0 < x * y'
viewing:
. as: '\field'
  via: '(X, +, *, 0, 1)'
written: "\textrm{ordered field}"


::
Since an ordered field is a field, it contains the additive
identiy, $0$.  Further, since it is an ordered set, it has
an ordering $<$.  Thus, in any ordered field, one can describe
what it means for an element of that field to be *positive*.

This is needed because the notion of a limit will be essential
to describing the *derivative* of a function that is an
essential part of the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

Further to describe derivatives, it is necessary to describe
the limit of a function, for which we will need to show that
for a given $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such
that the function satisfies certain properties.

This analysis thus depends on what it means for $x > 0$ for
any real number $x$.
::


[\positive:within{F}]
Defines: x
given: (X, +, *, 0, 1, <)
when: 'F := (X, +, *, 0, 1, <) is \ordered.field'
means:
. '0 < x'
written: "\textrm{positive}"
