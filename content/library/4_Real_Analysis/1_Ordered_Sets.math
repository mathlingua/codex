# Ordered Sets

To describe the First Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus, we need to describe the real numbers.
However, to do that, we need to describe what an
*ordered set* is.

An ordered set is a set along with a binary
operation defined next.
::

[\binary.relation:on{A}]
Defines: R
when: 'A is \set'
means: 'R \subset/ {A \set.product/ A}'
written: "\textrm{binary relation on } A?"
Metadata:
. overview: "Two elements $a, b \in A$ are said to be related
             if $(a, b) \in R$."


::
Now, before defining an ordered set, we need to
describe what it means for exactly one of several
statements to be true.
::


[\that{a}:not{b}{c}]
States:
that:
. 'a'
. not: 'b'
. not: 'c'
written: "a? \textrm{ holds but not } b? \textrm{ and not } c?"




[\exactly.one.of{a}{b}{c}]
States:
that:
. or:
  . '\that{a}:not{b}{c}'
  . '\that{b}:not{a}{c}'
  . '\that{c}:not{a}{b}'
written: "\textrm{exactly one of } a?, b?, \textrm{ and } c?"


::
Now an ordered set is a set with a relation that allows
elements to be ordered.  This is needed because the real
number system will turn out to be an ordered set.
::


[\ordered.set]
Defines: (S, <)
means:
. 'S is \set'
. '< is \binary.relation:on{S}'
. forAll: x, y
  suchThat: 'x, y in S'
  then:
  . '\exactly.one.of{x < y}{y < x}{x = y}'
. forAll: x, y, z
  suchThat: 'x, y, z in S'
  then:
  . if:
    . 'x < y'
    . 'y < z'
    then:
    . 'x < z'
viewing:
. as: '\set'
  via: 'S'
. membership:
  through: 'S'
written: "\textrm{ordered set}"


::
Within an ordered set the operations $<$, $>$, $\leq$,
and $\geq$ can be defined.
::


[a \leq{X}/ b]
States:
given: (S, <)
when:
. 'X := (S, <) is \ordered.set'
. 'a, b in X'
that:
. or:
  . 'a < b'
  . 'a = b'
written: "a? \leq b?"
called: "$a?$ is less than or equal to $b?$"


[a \lt{X}/ b]
States:
given: (S, <)
when:
. 'X := (S, <) is \ordered.set'
. 'a, b in X'
that:
. 'a < b'
written: "a? < b?"
called: "$a?$ is less than $b?$"


[a \gt{X}/ b]
States:
given: (S, <)
when:
. 'X := (S, <) is \ordered.set'
. 'a, b in X'
that:
. 'b \lt{X}/ a'
written: "a? > b?"
called: "$a?$ is greater than $b?$"


[a \geq{X}/ b]
States:
given: (S, <)
when:
. 'X := (S, <) is \ordered.set'
. 'a, b in X'
that:
. 'b \leq{X}/ a'
written: "a? \geq b?"
called: "$a?$ is greater than or equal to $b?$"


::
Now to define the Riemann Integral we will need to
generalize the *maximum* of a set of real numbers.

First, we need to describe what it means for an element
to be an upper bound of a set.
::


[\upper.bound:of{X}]
Defines: b
given: E, (S, <)
when:
. 'X := (S, <) is \ordered.set'
. 'E \subset/ S'
means:
. forAll: x
  suchThat: 'x in E'
  then: 'x \leq{X}/ b'
written: "\textrm{upper bound of } X?"


::
Any ordered set that has an upper bound is said to be
*bounded above*.
::


[\bounded.above.set]
Defines: X := (E, <)
means:
. 'X is \ordered.set'
. exists: b
  suchThat:
  . 'b is \upper.bound:of{X}'
viewing:
. as: '\set'
  via: 'E'
. membership:
  through: 'E'
written: "\textrm{bounded above}"


::
Now we can define the *supremum* of a set that generalizes
the maximum of a set.
::


[\supremum:of{X}]
Defines: beta
when: 'X is \bounded.above.set'
means:
. 'beta is \upper.bound:of{X}'
. forAll: b
  suchThat: 'b is \upper.bound:of{X}'
  then: 'b \geq{X}/ beta'
written: "\sup X?"
called: "supremum of $X?$"


::
In a similar way to how we generalized the maximum of a set,
we generalize the minimum of a set.  Hence, similar to the
upper bound of a set, we define a lower bound of a set.
::


[\lower.bound:of{X}]
Defines: b
given: E, (S, <)
when:
. 'X := (S, <) is \ordered.set'
. 'E \subset/ S'
means:
. forAll: x
  suchThat: 'x in E'
  then: 'x \geq{X}/ b'
written: "\textrm{lower bound of } X?"


::
Any set with a lower bound is said to be *bounded below*.
::


[\bounded.below.set]
Defines: X := (E, <)
means:
. 'X is \ordered.set'
. exists: b
  suchThat:
  . 'b is \lower.bound:of{X}'
viewing:
. as: '\set'
  via: 'E'
. membership:
  through: 'E'
written: "\textrm{bounded below}"


::
Next, we define the *infimum* of a set that generalizes
the minimum of a set.
::


[\infimum:of{X}]
Defines: alpha
when: 'X is \bounded.above.set'
means:
. 'alpha is \lower.bound:of{X}'
. forAll: a
  suchThat: 'a is \lower.bound:of{X}'
  then: 'a \leq{X}/ alpha'
written: "\inf X?"
called: "infimum of $X?$"


::
Last, we`\'`ll define what it means for a set to have
the *least-upper-bound property* which turns out to be
a key characteristic of the real numbers.
::

::
With the above, we can define the *least-upper-bound property*
as follows:
::


[\least.upper.bound.property.set]
Defines: X := (S, <)
means:
. 'X is \ordered.set'
. forAll: E
  suchThat:
  . 'E is \nonempty.set'
  . 'E \subset/ S'
  . 'E is \bounded.above.set'
  then:
  . exists: b
    suchThat:
    . 'b = \supremum:of{X}'
written: "\textrm{least-upper-bound property set}"
