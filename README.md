# Mathlore Content

This repository holds the content of Mathlore, a free and open repository of
mathematical knowledge encoded in the [Mathlingua](https://www.mathlingua.org)
language that allows mathematical concepts to be describe precisely and
rendered beautifully.

**Note:** Mathlore is a handcrafted collection of knowledge with entries
written by hand.  It is small but growing.
