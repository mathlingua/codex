    <h1>Welcome to the Math Codex</h1>
    <p>
        The Math Codex is a free and open repository of mathematical
        knowledge encoded in the <a href="https://www.mathlingua.org/">
        MathLingua</a> language that allows mathematical concepts to be
        describe precisely and rendered beautifully.
     </p>
     <p>
        The source code for the codex can be found GitHub at the
        <a href="https://github.com/DominicKramer/codex">codex</a> repo.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Math Codex is ideal for anyone that, when looking for a mathematical
        concept, wants to immediately see the exact precise description of the
        concept (definition, theorem, etc.) with links for more information,
        rather than have to search through documents providing
        an overview/history to find the precise description.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: The Math Codex is a handcrafted collection of knowledge with
        entries written by hand.  It is small but growing.
    </p>
    <h2>
        What is MathLingua
    </h2>
    <p>
        MathLingua is a language used to describe mathematical concepts in a way
        that is easy for mathematicians to write and can automatically checked
        by a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        MathLingua currently checks that definitions are used in theorems and
        other definitions in a way that is consistent with the requirements of
        the defintion.  In particular, the number of arguments expected by the
        definition.
    </p>
    <p>
        MathLingua currently doesn't provide automatic theorem proving
        capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead, where automatic theorem provers require complete formalization
        and encyclopedias have zero formalization, MathLingua lies
        in the middle to provide a language to precisely and concisely describe
        mathematical concepts that verifies they reference each other
        consistently but still be easy to write.
    </p>
    <p>
        That is, the Math Codex, utilizing MathLingua, is like an encyclopedia
        of math knowledge with type checking.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, unlike other encylopedias, each mathematical concept encoded
        in MathLingua is precise and concise with links to books and encylopedia
        entries for more information.
    </p>
    <h2>
        The Math Codex vs. mathlore.org
    </h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://mathlore.org/">mathlore.org</a> is another site
        developed by the author of MathLingua and the Math Codex that allows
        for searching for and contributing mathematical knowledge in a single
        place.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mathlore.org uses an older version of the MathLingua language and is
        instead geared toward recording mathematical information directly in
        LaTeX.  Furthermore, mathlore.org is designed to provide an advanced
        web application for sharing mathematical information.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Math Codex, on the other hand, is designed to be used primarily
        with the MathLingua language.  Furthermore, whereas mathlore.org uses
        sophisticated JavaScript frameworks and requires a server to run,
        the Math Codex uses plain JavaScript and HTML and does not require
        a server to run as all pages are statically generated.
    </p>
    <p>
        As such, the Math Codex is ideal for those that want to focus on
        mathematics and not worry about web application engineering concerns
        to either contribute to the Math Codex or build their own collection
        of math knowledge and easily host that collection on GitHub pags,
        factuly web pages, or other hosting providers.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Contributing
    </h2>
    <p>
        To contribute knowledge to the Math Codex
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo">fork</a>
        the <a href="https://github.com/DominicKramer/codex">codex</a> repo,
        update your fork, and create a pull request to incorporate your change.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Creating Your Own Codex
    </h2>
    <p>
        To create your own personal collection of mathematical knowledge
        based on the Math Codex,
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo">fork</a>
        the <a href="https://github.com/DominicKramer/codex">codex</a> repo.  The
        fork is your own personal copy of the Math Codex that you can change
        or add to however you like.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Authoring Mathematical Concepts
    </h2>
    <p>
        Any editor can be used to author mathematical concepts in the MathLingua
        language since MathLingua files (with a <code>.math</code> extension)
        are simply plain text files.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> editor
        is the preferred editor since the
        <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dominickramer.mathlingua-language-support">
        MathLingua Language Support</a> extension provides support for authoring
        content in the MathLingua language.
    </p>
    <p>
        The extension will automatically point out errors in your MathLingua
        code on file save and will render MathLingua documents side-by-side to
        the source code to allow easy editing.
    </p>
    <p>
        After writing code, simply run <code>./mlg render</code> from the
        root of the <code>codex</code> repository on your computer to regenerate
        the HTML rendered versions of your code.  This website, consists of the
        rendered version of the Math Codex repository.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: You need Java installed to run the <code>mlg</code> tool.  In
        addition, the <code>mlg</code> script currently only works on MacOS,
        Linux, and other Unix based platforms.  On Windows, you can run the
        mlg tool directly using <code>java -jar .bin\mathlingua.jar</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also run <code>./mlg check</code> to check your code or
        <code>./mlg watch</code> to automatically regenerate the HTML rendered
        version of your code whenever a file has been modified.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the HTML files generated by <code>./mlg render</code> are
        static and utilize plain JavaScript and CSS.  That is, they do not rely
        on any JavaScript framework or require a server to display.
    </p>
    <p>
        As such, they are ideal for hosting on GitHub pages or a university
        faculty provided web space.
